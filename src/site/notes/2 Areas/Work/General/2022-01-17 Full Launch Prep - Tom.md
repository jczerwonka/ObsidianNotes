## Offer
- Define offer first
	- [ ] What will be the downsell offer - Nikki
	- Confusion over what they were signing up for since SS and TCP were marketed at the same time
	- Change the offer - maybe lower price point but it wasn't really an effective conversion tool
	- [ ] Finalize offer by 1/31 - Jim/Nikki

- Be more rigid about the requirements to receive the offer, to make it more exclusive
	- People who go straight into TCP are almost being penalized
- Reduce the number of offers 24 last time
